# Cassandra (eventually) copy filter

This is me, playing with cassandra, protobuf, nodejs and typescript.

The intent is to eventually have something that allows to selectively copy values from one column family to the other.

In it's current state, this is as bare as bare can be. I'm still very new with typescript, intermediate with nodejs, and very new to cassandra.
So I'll be doing a lot of stupid stuff, with hopefully eventually having something useful and that I can be proud of.
